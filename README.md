# LexiconPCM80displayReplacement
a display replacement board for a Lexicon PCM 80 


This board is designed to fit in an Lexicon PCM 80 to replace a defective fluorescent display with an SSD1322 I had laying arround.
To convert the parallel data coming from the Lexicon a ESP32 is used and a level shifter to adapt the 5V to 3.3V
